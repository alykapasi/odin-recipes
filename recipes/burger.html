    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chuck beef (80% lean)</li>
        <li>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese</li>
        <li>burger toppings of choice</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron 
            flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly 
            browned. Set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, 
            as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of 
            parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately 
            smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage 
            as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light 
            pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately 
            cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered 
            patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
    </ul>
